git-mux can be configured with the following environment variables:

GIT_MUX_PROJECTS              Space-separated list of projects for selection.

GIT_MUX_PROJECT_PARENTS       Space-separated list of directories that contain projects
                              - defaults to $PROJECTS or $HOME
                              - selects from child dirs using \`find\` (depth of 1)
                              - ignored if $GIT_MUX_PROJECTS is set

GIT_MUX_SELECT_CMD            Command used to select a project
                              - defaults to `fzf`.
                              - receives the directory list from stdin
                              - sends a single, selected directory to stdout

GIT_MUX_BRANCH_PREFIX         A string to prepend to new branches created via task
                              - off by default
                              - the resulting branch format is "<prefix>/<name>"
                              - ignored if the provided <name> already contains a "/"
                              - common examples: "feature" or "$(id -un)"

GIT_MUX_NEW_WORKTREE_CMD      Commands to execute in the tmux window when a new
                              git worktree is created via task.
                              - off by default
                              - example: [ -f "./package.json" ] && npm i

GIT_MUX_LOG_FILE              Path to a file for printing logs,
                              - attempts to default to (in order):
                                - "$XDG_STATE_HOME/shutils/git-mux.log"
                                - "$HOME/.local/state/shutils/git-mux.log"
                                - "$HOME/.shutils/git-mux.log"

GIT_MUX_LOG                   Set to any value to enable logging
                              - off by default

The configuration values are printed in the logs when git-mux is run.

  # Select a git branch and create or switch to its git worktree and tmux window
  git mux t

  # If 'feature/123' is a valid path, it will be used for the task.
  # Otherwise assume it is a git branch, creating the branch if it doesn't exist.
  # If the project is a bare repo, create and/or switch to its worktree.
  # Otherwise checkout the new branch.
  # All 3 cases create and/or switch to a tmux window named '123' (basename).
  # The window name can be specified with an additional argument.
  git mux task feature/123

  # Run commands in a tmux window named npm_stuff without switching to it
  # Specifying a window name is required when sending commands
  git mux task ~/projects/my-app npm_stuff npm i && npm run build

# Contributing

I welcome and appreciate contributions from anyone and everyone!

## What should I work on?

You can help most by:

- Logging issues to help improve the project
- Creating pull requests for existing issues

## Before filing an issue

If something isn't working the way you expect, take a look at the
[existing issues](https://github.com/benelan/git-mux/issues) before logging
a new one. If there are no duplicates, please log a new issue! Make sure to
provide all of the requested info from the appropriate
[issue template](https://github.com/benelan/git-mux/issues/new/choose).
Some other things to consider:

- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Detail what is happening now vs what should happen
- Describe how to reproduce the issue, including step by step instructions,
  environment, version, and any other relevant information.
- Can it be reliably reproduced If not, mention how often it happens and under
  what circumstances.
- Did this problem start after a recent release? If so, which version?

## Before submitting a pull request

I am accepting and appreciate pull requests, but please log an issue first.
I would hate to turn down your hard work for some reason. Mention your interest
in working on the issue when you log it, and I'll provide feedback/guidance.

Also, this project follows [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org).
